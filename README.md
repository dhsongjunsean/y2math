# Welcome to Y2 Math with Python programming!

By programming your solutions to math problems, you
- gain a deeper understanding of the mathematical thinking processes
- can quickly verify your answers (eg test if a big number is prime)
- are empowered to automate calculation (let the machine do the hard work)

Current topics:
- Averages of Statistical Data (mean, median, mode)
- Set theory (unique elements, intersection)
- Graphing techniques (straight line graph)
- Programming (searching)
- Real-life Mathematical Applications (compound interest)

Please contribute! Submit pull requests for
- problems without solutions
- problems with incomplete/partial solutions
- problems with alternative solutions (yes sometimes there are more than one way to solve a problem and we really welcome them!)
- interesting and related problems not limited to those currently available
- anything you feel this repository can be improved

## Note: Do not simply copy and paste text/code from other sites. Inappropriate pull requests will be marked as invalid and rejected.
